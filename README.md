# Code to ellyptical python
The code in this repo (specifically, Code-To-Ellyptical-Python.py) will convert any python code file to ellyptical python (see (this)[https://susam.net/elliptical-python-programming.html] for reference) by **overwriting** it.

Two example files are provided with the code: example_python.py is a normal python file with some simple code, example_ellyptical-python.py is example_python.py converted to ellyptical python. If you run them, they will behave the same (albeit ellyptical python is a little slower).

You can convert an ellyptical python file to ellyptical python (ellyptical python-ception) but usually both the converting process and the resulting file are quite slow. This is probably due to the massive amount of characters to write: print("Hello, world!") passed through my converter twice will occupy about 12.5 kilobytes.
